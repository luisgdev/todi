# todi

Another command line tool to manage to-do tasks.
Made to be simple and easy to use.

I created this project in order to learn the process of publishing a package in [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/todi/).
So yes, you can install it from `pip` or clone/fork this project.


### Features:

- 📝 `List`, `Add`, `Update` and `Delete` tasks.
- ✔️ Change status: `TODO` (default), `DOING` and `DONE`.
- 🗑️ `Clean` command to remove `DONE` tasks.


# Install

        pip install todi
